# Chatbot Project
=====================

A simple chatbot implemented in Python, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input.

## Overview
--------

This chatbot project uses a rule-based approach to match user input with predefined responses. It utilizes regular expressions to split user input into individual words and phrases, and then checks for matches against a dictionary of recognized words and phrases.

## Features
--------

* **Basic conversation flow**: The chatbot follows a basic conversation flow, allowing users to interact with it in a natural way.
* **Predefined responses**: The chatbot has a set of predefined responses to common user inputs, such as greetings and farewells.
* **Longer responses**: The chatbot can provide longer responses to specific user inputs, such as requests for advice or information about eating.
* **Unknown input handling**: The chatbot can handle unknown user input and respond with a default message.

## Code Structure
-----------------

The code is structured into three main functions:

* `message_probability`: calculates the probability of a user input matching a recognized word or phrase.
* `check_all_messages`: checks all possible responses against the user input and returns the best match.
* `get_response`: takes user input, splits it into individual words and phrases, and returns the best matching response.

## Technical Requirements
-------------------------

* **Python 3.x**: The chatbot requires Python 3.x to run.
* **No external dependencies**: The chatbot does not require any external dependencies to run.

## Usage
-----

To use the chatbot, simply run the script and interact with it by typing messages. The chatbot will respond accordingly.

## Example Use Cases
-------------------

* **Basic conversation**: Try greeting the chatbot with "hello" or "hi", and see how it responds.
* **Requesting advice**: Ask the chatbot for advice by typing "give advice", and see how it responds.
* **Unknown input**: Try typing something that the chatbot doesn't recognize, and see how it handles unknown input.
